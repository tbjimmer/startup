[My Notes](notes.md)

A customizer of a weapon kit based on Splatoon 3's kit system. It allows for the selection of a main weapon alongside a sub weapon and a special ability.

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ X ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - short, sweet, and to the point
- [ X ] Description of key features - I'm certain this list will change as I get more into the project
- [ X ] Description of how you will use each technology - I'm unsure of how accurately my uses are, this will likely be updated later on
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Let's say you are a Splatoon enjoyer (such as myself) and you think it would be fun to dream about a custom kit that Nintendo
should add into the game as the weapon's third and final kit. That would be super fun to even test out in game, but that feature 
does not yet exist, so we are going to build step one of that, and create a program that allows users to select from any of the 
11 weapon types, 14 sub weapons, and 18 special weapons to construct their ultimate combo!

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **CSS** - Create a clean look for the site with a light and dark theme 
- **React** - Affirms login, weapon change by selection, posts completed kit
- **Service** - Backend service to confirm individual kits, post the kit, and retrieve other's posted kits
- **DB/Login** - Login registry and hold all posted weapon kits
- **WebSocket** - When finalized, the weapon and its associated kit are posted to the public page
